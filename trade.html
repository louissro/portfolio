            <p class="overview-text"><strong>Overview:</strong> During move-in and move-out weeks for USC, many hustle onto Facebook Marketplace (FBM) to either 1. purchase 
                furniture and mini-goods for their new campus housing or 2. rush to sell everything before they need to go back home.
                However, scammers have began to exploit desperate college students in this process, attempting to steal money and
                goods from them. Many voiced their concerns on how they don’t feel safe buying/selling on FBM, but have no choice because
                there are no other platforms dedicated to college students. How can we design and provide a centralized product that provides 
                comfort and ease to students when it comes to buying/selling, but also a friendly user-experience?</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>We're so familiar with our college campuses, but still scared of these third-party transactions</h3>
            <p>Many universites in the United States have their own procedures and culture when it comes to buying/selling their college housing furniture or random college goods. The reason
                behind this is because: <ol><li>it’s easier if someone local (or even a college student) is on the other end of the transaction;</li><li>many of the goods sold are objects that are mostly needed
                by college students for their housing situations;</li><li>deals are reasonable as financials are one of the top priorities for college students;</li></ol></p>
            <p>I attend USC and we use mostly Facebook Marketplace (FBM) for these transactions. However, I am aware other universities use Reddit, GroupMe, their own university platforms, etc. At USC,
                many of my peers and friends voiced their concerns on the safety and reliability for these platforms, because scams are common and it’s always scary to meet a stranger with money
                on the line. One friend of mine managed to get a good deal from a stranger for a dining table she really wanted; however, it turned out that the dining table was not how the photo portrayed it,
                and she felt lied to.</p>
            <p>I conducted a survey among college students regarding their own experience buying/selling on FBM, and here are some key insights:
                <ul><li>FBM was 1st on most used platforms, and Word of Mouth (friend recommendations) came 2nd.</li>
                <li>31.2% of respondents stated they felt unsafe and unsure when buying/selling on FBM.</li>
                <li>While some stated FBM made them feel “satisfied” and “excited”, many also stated that they feel “cautious” and “disgusted”.</li>
                <li>70% of respondents stated they would prefer to use an app dedicated to college students buying/selling platform.</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p>I created one main question to help guide me throughout my research process:
                <ul><li>What are the main factors that prevent users from fully enjoying the experience of FBM and its purpose of buying/selling?</li></ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Target Audience</strong>
            <br>FBM is used by a wide range of individuals. However, for the sake of research and simplicity, we narrowed it down to:
            <ul><li>Current undergraduate college students at USC</li>
            <li>Ages 18-22</li></ul></p>
            <p><strong>Market Analysis</strong>
            <br>Current undergraduate enrollment at USC is: 21,000
            <br>On the survey, 70% of respondents stated they have used FBM to buy/sell.
            <br>Taking into account that not all USC undergraduate students use the platform; we can estimate the market size to be around ~14,700 students.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>
            <br>The top two used platforms for buying/selling at USC is: FBM and GroupMe</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <h3>Brainstorming </h3>
            <p>Currently, 80% of students use their smartphone device to buy/sell on FBM. Hence, I’ve decided to design a mobile app. The inspiration comes from
            Depop, a third-party selling platform dedicated to apparel and fashion items.</p>
            <p>I got the opportunity to use the Affinity Diagram template on FigJam (first time using FigJam as well!). I decided to note every single idea and thought
                that popped up into my head, as I felt that categorizing them would rather restrict me from free-flowing my ideas. 
            </p>
            <img class="affinity" src="img/affinity.png" alt="Affinity Diagram">
            <p>From there, I conducted research on 
                Depop, and Korean third-party selling platform Karrot to figure out what their essential features are, and how it implements into the overall user experience.
                I've decided for Trade n' Exchange, these are the essential features:
                <ul>
                    <li>A 5-star ranking system on sellers/buyers to allow users to see reviews and their overall persona on the app</li>
                    <li>A search function to easily locate their item in a timely, efficient manner</li>
                    <li>Users must verify their student status in order to become eligible to buy/sell on the platform</li>
                    <li>Chat feature to allow all discussion and transactions to occur on the app for security and record reasons</li>
                    <li>"Suggested for you" section to personalize user experience and promote buying</li>
                </ul></p>
            <h4>Low Fidelity Wireframe</h4>
            <p>Considering the potential essential features listed above, I sketched a low fidelity wireframe in order to visualize the necessary design components
                for the app.
            </p>
            <img class="sketch" src="img/sketch1.png" alt="Low Fidelity Sketch 1">
            <img class="sketch" src="img/sketch2.png" alt="Low Fidelity Sketch 2">
            <p>I've decided the navigation bar will be a key compontent in the user experience, as I wanted to create a centralized point where users
                can navigate to wherever feature or component. I've added another layout of the app, where it will serve as the Profile page. Users
                can customize the page with a profile picture, short bio/description explaining who they are at their respective college campuses, and what
                products they're selling.
                </p>

                        users will be asked to enter their personal information such as Name and Email. 
                        This step will also include the student status verification process, where
                        users must enter their student ID number as well as a photo of their student ID.

                        There is a "On sale" section below as well, in order to cater for the financial nature that most college students face.

                    <p>Users can use the navigation bar located on the bottom in order to navigate through the app and its features. Its components include
                        the home button, the search button, the sell/list button, the chat button, and the profile button. Each button leads to another page
                        of the app, where users can access its respective features.

                <li>The blue and grey colors were used for the navigation bar to align with the logo</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="final-conclusions">
            <h2>Final Conclusions</h2>
            <p>While this app did solve the main issue of promoting a safer, friendlier environment when buying/selling on campus, there are still areas of improvement that can be made in terms
                of the logistics. The concept of buying/selling is extremely dominant in almost all universites around the nation, and there's many potential when it comes to this app. It can be
                noted that buying and selling can be considered as two separate experiences through the app, especially because our listing option in the navigation bar allows exclusively only to list.
                Overall, this case study was extremely enjoyable, and I feel that I am more knowledge in creating products from ideation to execution!

              <p>Our team created three different visual value propositions, and through surveys and interviews with fellow college students, we've decided VVP #3 showcases the app in the most descriptive manner.</p>
            <h1>Initial Wireframe</h1>
            <p>Through our research, we created a wireframe to solve the issue with these solutions: <ol><li>Let users scan their fridge for easy use of app</li> <li>Allow users to manually add their own ingredients</li> <li>Let users favorite their liked recipes</li></ol></p>

            <h2>Execution</h2>
            <h3>Creating high fidelity prototype to showcase the app's essential features and design</h3>
            <h1>Prototype</h1>
            <p>Feel free to use this embed Figma code to look around our prototype! You are able to directly click on the buttons and icons, quite literally as if you're using a phone.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p><strong>Design Intentions</strong></p>
            <p><ul><li>The matcha-tone color was chosen for the background to radiate calmness and tranquiility, in order to make an already stressful process less stressful</li><li>The blue and grey colors were used for the navigation bar to align with the logo</li></ul></p>
            <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
            <p>I had to learn how to balance my desire to be an independent worker vs. a team player. I love to work on my own time and on my own pace, but I also realized that I need to be on the same page as my teammates to progress forward efficiently.</p>
            <p>I got to truly learn how to work in a team! This situation provided me with the opportunity to working in a space where new perspectives are welcome, ideas are constantly being bounced against each other, and we individually can work more with our own strengths. I also learned a lot on my listening skills and habits!</p>
            <p><strong>Final Conclusions</strong></p>
            <p>While this app did solve the main issue of promoting a safer, friendlier environment when buying/selling on campus, there are still areas of improvement that can be made in terms of the logistics. The concept of buying/selling is extremely dominant in almost all universites around the nation, and there's many potential when it comes to this app. It can be noted that buying and selling can be considered as two separate experiences through the app, especially because our listing option in the navigation bar allows exclusively only to list. Overall, this case study was extremely enjoyable, and I feel that I am more knowledge in creating products from ideation to execution!</p>

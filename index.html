                92% of students from our user research study mentioned that they struggle with maintaining a consistent and healthy eating habit because they don't know what to cook or what groceries to purchase.
              </p>
              <p>
                They often resort to easier meal alternatives, such as frozen foods or delivery/take-out.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                We're aiming to solve the problem of students having trouble
                looking for study spots on campus.
              </p>
              <h3>Why?</h3>
              <p>
                70% of the USC student body live off-campus: many of them
                commute from home to campus.
              </p>
              <p>
                They often have gaps between their daily schedule where they
                can't necessarily go back home, but they have nowhere else to
                stay or rest on campus.
              </p>
              <h3>How?</h3>
              <p>
                PodSC is a full-stack web app being worked on by a team of 4,
                made for the USC community.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to minimize time spent looking for a spot, and maximize
                time spent studying and resting.
              </p>

              Transactions are safer than ever through Recontix, where students
              can resell and exchange concert tickets to buyers exclusive to
              their own college campus.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Transactions should be simply and easy, but most importantly,
                safe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not restricting, but limiting transactions to within campus
                radius and official students will help students feel safer when
                reselling and exchanging concert tickets.
              </p>
              <h3>Why?</h3>
              <p>
                Los Angeles is the heart of entertainment & media, and more than
                ever, students are attending live concerts and events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ticket exchange and reselling occurs often among students at
                USC, but many question the reliability and safety for these
                transactions.
              </p>
              <h3>How?</h3>
              <p>
                Recontix is a full-stack web/mobile app that will allow USC
                students to validate their profiles first through their USC
                unique ID numbers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want students to feel safe and at ease when conducting risky
                transactions with strangers.

              <p>
                We wanted to curate a space and community where student
                creatives can get together to innovate and experiment with
                sparking ideas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our amazing 15-people executive board members meet weekly to
                strategize and event plan for our 30+ general members to allow
                them to work in teams of 5-8 in sprints to deliver their
                projects by the semester deadline.
              </p>
              <h3>Why?</h3>
              <p>
                We talked with students in USC Roski School of Art and Design on
                their perception of the creative community currently on campus,
                and many have voiced that they felt a gap in the physical arts
                space.
              </p>
              <p>
                They wanted: 1) a diverse creative community mixed with both
                digital and physical art interests, 2) to explore different
                areas of creativity, 3) opportunities to showcase their work to
                the USC community beyond their school/classes
              </p>
              <h3>How?</h3>
              <p>
                Creative Labs SC is a project-based organization that promotes
                student creatives to pursue passion projects in whatever field,

              </p>
              <p>
                We want creativity and exploration to be accessible to all

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Peppermint is founded with the mission to redefine undergarments
                and basics for the up and coming generation. At Peppermint,
                freedom of self-identity, diversity and sustainability is
                celebrated.
              </p>
              <h3>What?</h3>
              <p>
                I created and developed the overall product marketing structure,
                by interviewing customers to gain product insight, which was
                directly updated onto our product roadmaps.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took advantage of being a Gen-Z myself to help Peppermint
                better target their desired demographic of young teens and
                adults aged 16-25 who look for sustainability and identity
                values in a brand.

                <p>
                  ITP 104 is a course provided by the Information Technology
                  Program (ITP) under the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I served as a Learner's Assistant, directly managing 7 students and providing help with their code and assignments.
                </p>
                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>
                  This class holds a dear place in my heart, as it's opened me to a world full of fun and exciting new opportunities. I never knew what web development nor coding was prior, but with the help of my amazing professor, I'm learning to create it into a passion.

              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Trade n' Exchange is a case study of a web/mobile app that focuses on safer and easier transactions for college students buying/selling used home goods and furniture.
              </p>
              <h3>Why?</h3>
              <p>
                A friend of mine got scammed on Facebook Marketplace when she was trying to buy a lamp for her bedroom. I saw this as unfortunate, but also unfair that desperate college students were being targetted.
              </p>
              <p>I wanted to take matters into my own hands, and created a product that limits listings to only students that are verified USC students.</p>
              <p>I bring inspiration directly from my own favorite product/platform, Depop and their amazing way of showing the buyer/seller their ratings and reviews from previous users who interacted with them.</p>

                  I am highly adaptable to new environments and enjoy learning
                  new concepts.
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Quick background: I moved 13 times around multiple countries such as South Korea, Bangladesh, China. I hated this about me as I felt it made me unstable, but I quickly realized it's a valuable skill I could leverage when it comes to networking, creating, and ideating. It's equipped me with a wider range of understanding and perspectives that it's given me more courage to try new things!
                </p>
                <h4>I love to experiment.</h4>
                <p>
                  What I love about working in social media is that the foundation of any content creation revolves around experimenting. I grew up constantly trying new things, and to have found this trait in a career is something I don't want to let go of. 
                </p>
                <h4>I love to create.</h4>
                <p>
                  I firmly believe everyone is a creative at heart. It's just the environment and resources around them play a role in their level of creative expression. I founded Creative Labs SC, a student-led creative community that fosters experimenting with your creativity, and it's been amazing to see so many students like me realize where their creative passions lie and have even seen some take it to the next level into a career!
